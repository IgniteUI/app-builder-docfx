# Design-to-code App Builder story

App Builder enables you to go from Design to Code in a single click. Import Figma, Sketch and Adobe XD files and create Apps directly from the Designs.

This happens by importing your design files with App Builder or by using the Indigo.Design System plugins directly inside Figma, Sketch and Adobe XD. The plugins even deliver custom themes, import images assets, and ensure all components are mapped one-to-one with controls from the App Builder Toolbox. More below.

## Indigo.Design System

### What is a Design System?

Design systems are usually described as a set of design principles and assets that translate to consistency in the way you build user interfaces. The three core advantages of using a design system are:

- Tunes into a specific usage context and app domain.
- Works as an inventory of UX design patterns and brand style guidance.
- Speeds up the design process and significantly improves consistency.

### Turn your designs into code

Here are the 4 simple steps to get from Design to Code with the App Builder with simple drag & drop.

#### File import

##### Step 1: Click New App from the Indigo Cloud or App Builder Home Screen

## Adobe XD UI Kit

Crafted from the ground-up to equip designers with a modern and easy-to-use arsenal of tools which allow them to design wireframes and apps, Adobe XD is one of the popular vector graphic design platforms in the market today. Along with wireframe features, designers can create hi-fidelity prototypes, collaborate across teams through the design process, configure animations and collect feedback.

**How to Convert Adobe XD to HTML Code using App Builder?**

There are a couple pre-requisites to get started:

1. Login to your account or start a free trial of App Builder 
2. Login to your account or start a free trial of Adobe XD 

Once you have installed Adobe XD, you need to install the Indigo.Design App Builder plugin, which enables design to code.  You can access this from the Stock & Marketplace -> Plugins in the Creative Cloud app, simply search for Indigo.Design.

Once you have installed the Indigo.Design App Builder plugin, you need a design based on the UI Kits from Infragistics. The way design to code works with App Builder is that designs in Adobe XD must be created using out UI Kits, which are full-featured, extensible and customizable libraries of UI components and UI patterns that accelerate the design phase.

When your design is ready, you can publish it to App Builder.

For more in-depth tutorial how to import your Adobe XD designs into App Builder, [please refer to this blog article](https://www.infragistics.com/community/blogs/b/jason_beres/posts/adobe-xd-to-html-code) that shows everything with images and detailed descriptions.

## Sketch UI Kit

A strong design-to-code movement emerged in the last few years to pick up where Sketch left off – the goal being to create a seamless, consistent, easy-to-use process that ensures Sketch designs can be easily transformed into usable code.
