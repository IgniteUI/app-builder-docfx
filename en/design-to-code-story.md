# Design-to-Code App Builder story

App Builder enables you to go from Design to Code in a single click. Import Figma, Sketch and Adobe XD files and create Apps with ease. Use the [Indigo.Design System](https://www.infragistics.com/products/appbuilder/ui-toolkit) plugins directly inside Figma, Sketch and Adobe XD to deliver custom themes, import images assets, and ensure all components are mapped one-to-one with controls from the App Builder Toolbox.

## Indigo.Design System

The [Indigo.Design System](https://www.infragistics.com/products/appbuilder/ui-toolkit) uniquely combines UI Kits that map to real UI controls and components, with tooling that delivers unprecedented productivity helping digital product teams go from pixel-perfect design to production-ready code. Anything you design can be turned into real, usable code, simplifying the designer-developer handoff.
### What is a Design System?

Design systems are usually described as a set of design principles and assets that translate to consistency in the way you build user interfaces. The three core advantages of using a design system are:

- Tunes into a specific usage context and app domain.
- Works as an inventory of UX design patterns and brand style guidance.
- Speeds up the design process and significantly improves consistency.

### Turn Your Designs into Code
Use file import or your favorite design tool.
#### File import

Below are the 4 simple steps to get from Design to Code with the App Builder with simple drag & drop.
