## Sketch UI Kit

A strong design-to-code movement emerged in the last few years to pick up where Sketch left off â€“ the goal being to create a seamless, consistent, easy-to-use process that ensures Sketch designs can be easily transformed into usable code.

## App Builder Sketch Importer
Here are the 4 simple steps to get from Design to Code with the App Builder with a drag & drop.

Step 1: Click New App from the Indigo.Design Apps Home Screen
Create New Angular App from Sketch Design

<img class="responsive-img" style="width: 100%; box-shadow: 5px -4px 13px 1px grey" src="../images/new-app-dialog.PNG" />
<p style="width: 100%; text-align:center;">New app dialog</p>

Step 2: Drag your Sketch file into the "Create from existing design" Drop Area
Sketch to Angular Drag and Drop

<img class="responsive-img" style="width: 100%; box-shadow: 5px -4px 13px 1px grey" src="../images/import-designs-dialog.PNG" />
<p style="width: 100%; text-align:center;">Import designs dialog</p>

Step 3: Review the Design in the Cloud IDE
App in Web App Builder from Sketch

<img class="responsive-img" style="width: 100%; box-shadow: 5px -4px 13px 1px grey" src="../images/generate-code.PNG" />
<p style="width: 100%; text-align:center;">Code generation</p>

Step 4: Review or Download your Angular code
You can choose to use the buttons in the upper right of the IDE to Generate App or Preview your app and see code. Here you can see the Preview option with your running app and your code of HTML, CSS or TypeScript.

<img class="responsive-img" style="width: 100%; box-shadow: 5px -4px 13px 1px grey" src="../images/download-project.PNG" />
<p style="width: 100%; text-align:center;">Code generation</p>


Just like that, a design or a developer can go from sketch to code with a web-based WYSIWYG tool. Teams can design and build real apps blazing in a cloud-based WYSIWYG drag & drop and get code - complete with web layout, CSS and even data.
