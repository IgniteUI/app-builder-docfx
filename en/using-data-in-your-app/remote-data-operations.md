# Remote Data Operations

This remote data functionality allows **Card**, **Column Layout**, **Absolute Layout** and **Row Layout** components in App Builder to load data from a server and display it in a paginated fashion. This is similar to **Grid Remote Paging**, but tailored for specific (non-grid) components whose data can be repeated.

## Key Benefits
- **Improved performance**: Fetch only the required subset (page) of data from the server, avoiding large payloads.
- **Scalable**: Handles large datasets by loading data in smaller chunks.
- **Flexible UI**: Lets you place repeated items, like Cards, in a custom layout while benefiting from paging features.

## How Component-first Remote Data Works

When you enable remote data on a repeated component (e.g., a Card iterating over a JSON array), App Builder fetches only the necessary records from your REST or Swagger endpoint. If **Paging** is enabled, a **Paginator** component is automatically added, along with internal variables such as `pageIndex` and `pageSize` when set up. Changing pages triggers new server requests to retrieve just that page of data.

## Setting Up Remote Data

### **1. Add a Repeaters Component**
- From the **Toolbox**, drag a **Card**, **Column Layout**, **Absolute Layout**, **Grid Layout** or **Row Layout** (these support paging so far).
- Select the component and open its **Properties** panel, which will appear on the right hand side.

### **2. Configure Remote Data**
- Under **Repeat**, click **Data**.
- Choose a REST endpoint or a Swagger definition that provides the JSON response.
- If paging is needed, ensure your API supports parameters like `pageIndex` and `pageSize` so you can page effectivelly.

### **3. Enable Pagination**
- Toggle **Paging** on.
- App Builder will wrap your component in a **Row Layout** to ensure the Paginator is placed correctly with your host component together (**Card/Layout**).
- A **Paginator** is added, so you will need to set it up by clicking on it and opening it's own properties panel. Check out how to set it up here: [Grid Remote Paging](../using-data-in-your-app/grid-remote-paging.md)

### **4. Preview the Setup**
- Once you've completed the setup and your local variables and actions have been generated, congratulationsâ€”you have successfully configured remote paging for your component!
- Click **Preview** to load the first page of data.
- Changing pages or page sizes triggers new requests, fetching only that portion of data.

**Expected Result:**
- The component (**Card/Column Layout/Row Layout/Grid Layout/Absolute Layout**) paginates like a Grid, dynamically fetching only the needed data for the current page.

## Known Limitations

### **1. Row Layout Enforcement**
- To ensure proper placement of the **Paginator**, App Builder will wrap your repeated component inside a **Row Layout** with **Wrap enabled**. This can alter your design if you decide to use it for other purposes.
- **Workaround**: Re-organize or re-parent components manually if needed.

### **2. Variable-first Approach Not Yet Supported**
- Currently, data must be bound directly to the component, and App Builder handles variable creation behind the scenes.
- **Future Enhancement**: A **Variable-first** approach will let you create data request variables first and bind multiple components to them.
