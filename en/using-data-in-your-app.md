The Indigo Design App Builder Data features lets users add, edit and use external data source in the application they are developing. By default, the Indigo Design App Builder comes with a mock Northwind data source which users can use for reference. Currently, a JSON type data sources can be added, enabling users to upload their own JSON file or provide a Rest API URL with the data source.
