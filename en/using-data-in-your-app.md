# Data Feature overview 
The App Builder Data features let users add, edit and use external data source in the application they are developing. By default, the App Builder comes with a mock Northwind data source which users can use for reference. Below you can find different ways to set up Rest API data sources:
- By using a JSON type data source, enabling users to upload their own JSON file or provide a Rest API URL with the data source.
- By using a Swagger URL or file definition (json/yaml).

All added data sources are placed in the data toolbox and users can expand/collapse each data source in order to see the included tables and selected fields.

The App Builder also supports **nested collection inside a response object**. You can now bring in APIs that wrap the return collection in a metadata object (e.g. oData and others) and use the nested collection for data-binding components such as the Grid or to perform repeat operations based on it.

## Adding a data source
The App Builder Data feature enables users to add external data sources, such as JSON (Rest API), Excel or CSV file, either by uploading a file, or linking to external publicly available source. Only Rest API option is available in the initial release of this feature.

> [!NOTE]
> Data sources added to the App Builder are restricted to the user space and are visible only to the user that added them, or to their team space (when the teams feature is available).

## Adding a Swagger data source
The power of Swagger tools starts with the OpenAPI Specification â€” the industry standard for RESTful API design. 

You can now specify a Swagger definition (by providing a file URL or simply upload it) and an intuitive design will help you pick an endpoint an data fields, with ease. You can later on bind this data source to a component like Grid, Card, List or any other bindable component.

Check out the [full article on how to add a Swagger definition](open-api-swagger-support.md) and bind your data to it.

## Selecting data fields and changing fields type
When a data source has been added, users can connect a particular data field to a component section. In order for this to be done, first select the component (a card component is used in the example below), then change Repeat mode to Data and scroll down the menu to locate and select the table from the Data Source that you want to connect to. Finally, connect the card section with the selected table field.

## Connecting Data Source to a repeated component
When a data source has been added, users can connect a particular data field to a component section. In order for this to be done, first select the component (a card component is used in the example below), then change Repeat mode to Data and scroll down the menu to locate and select the table from the Data Source that you want to connect to. Finally, connect the card section with the selected table field.
